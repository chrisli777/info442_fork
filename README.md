Mission Statement: Amplifying the voices of elders who have caretakers in that relationship.

Problem Statement: In home care setting, communication between elders, caregivers, and families is often unclear. Elders lack a voice, families lack visibility, and caregivers are overwhelmed with logging. We need a simple, transparent way to keep everyone connected.
(I'll do more research and add to this today, 4/12 - Vidhya)
Some info online:
https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10946444/ - this article from the National Institute of Health talks about communication and interestingly financial issues that separate caretakers from elders. Importantly, one of the conclusions is that a SUPPORT SYSTEM IS NEEDED to improve the relationships between elderly, their families, and caretakers, giving our app reason to exist

https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8160020/ - this article (also by NIH) talks about challenges in patient-family interactions. The three main ones include obtrusive behavior from caretakers that the family doesn't like, eldlerly autonomy, and navigating the family's urges to participate in the caretaking process. Conclusion found that collaborative discussion between elderly, caretakers, and family led to a more harmonious and productive caretaking environment, further giving our app reason to exist.
